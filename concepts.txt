                to match the query if not explicitly specified.If specified it will search for that property of items.

--> Custom Filter :-

    eventsApp.filter('filterName',function(){
        return function(args){
            // filtering logic and return goes here.
        }
    })

/*************************************   SERVICES  ***********************/

--> A service is just a worker object that performs some sort of business logic.
--> Services allow you to encapsulate Reusable business logic into an object that can be shared and reused throughout the application.
--> Services also helps in bringing modularity into app. Single Responsibility Principle.states that an object should only have a Single
    responsibility.
--> Services can be injected to controllers and other services that need them.This helps in having access to the functionality when u need 
    them.
